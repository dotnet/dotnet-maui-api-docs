# .NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) API docs

This repository contains the ECMA-XML reference documentation for .NET Multi-platform App UI (MAUI). It's published at the [.NET API browser](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/). The documentation for APIs is built from /// in the [dotnet/maui repository](https://github.com/dotnet/maui). Therefore, any API documentation updates should be made to the /// in that repo, not via PRs to the ECMA-XML stored in this repo.

The repository for conceptual .NET MAUI document is the [dotnet/docs-maui repository](https://github.com/dotnet/docs-maui).
